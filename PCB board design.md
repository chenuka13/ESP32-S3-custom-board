<h3>Important points</h3>
<div>
<ul>
  <li>Place Capacitor's as close as possible to the IC that they'll be connecting to for best performance</li>
  <li>Line-up components to ease tracing</li>

<ul>
  <li>Make sure to route the USB D+ and D- lines first. most important traces. to upload the code. route these traces as a <a href="https://resources.altium.com/p/what-are-differential-pairs-and-differential-signals"><mark>differential pair</a></mark></li>
  <li>trace the USB D+ and D- lines close as possible and the same length. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySuUZEjARPY">Video explaining USB protocol</a>)</li>
  <li>Avoid routing any analog signals too close</li>
  <li>Use vias to connect top layer to bottom layer. keep this to a minimum. make use of the top layer.</li>
  <li>For handling ALL ground connections, just break a trace slightly away from the pad and connect a via to the end</li>
  <li>Fill the PCB with a gound plane (Copper zone). All the ground vias will be connected.</li>

  <li>Place extra ground vias all around for adequate thermal relief</li>
  <li>Check for clearance, hole sizes, thermal</li>
  <li>Most clearance can be ignored since it might be between holes and pads on pre-built footprints. Adjust the once that was placed by us.</li>

  <li>For any â€œtrack has unconnected end" errors, you should just click on them and delete them manually</li>

  <li> For any thermal errors, they can be easily fixed by adding some extra traces going out.</li>
